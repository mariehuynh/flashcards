Machine learning is a big deal here in Silicon Valley, but what about human learning?  Why not apply concepts from CS to improve the way we learn?  

We're building a user-friendly tool that makes human learning more efficient by embedding algorithms that reorganize the data you wish to consume based on constant self assessment. I plan to use this to reduce the mental overhead of manually running them myself. I hope that it will help other people who will be able to benefit from the underlying algorithms without ever having to be conscious of them.
